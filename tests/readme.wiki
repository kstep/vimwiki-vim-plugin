= Purpose =

This directory contains HTML-generation tests and tools to execute them.

= Files =

 * *readme.wiki* - this file
 * *test.py*     - Python scripts to run tests
 * *vimrc*       - configuration file
 * *.htmltest*   - tests

== Files generated by vimwiki ==

 * *wiki*     - directory with generated wiki pages
 * *expected* - directory with expected HTML files generated by testing tool
 * *actual*   - directory with actual HTML files generated by vimwiki

= Usage =

== Quick start ==

Just execute `python test/test.py` on Unix or `python test\test.py` on Windows,
you'll see list of tests prefixed either by '+' or '!' signs for successfull
and failed test respectively:

{{{
+ hr
+ table
! some
expected:
bla-bla
actual:
foo-bar
}}}

== Detailed description ==

Current directory must be set to the root of working copy.

Unix:    `python tests/test.py [options] [test..]`
Windows: `python tests\test.py [options] [test..]`

Supported *options*:
 * *-s*, *--side-by-side* - print actual and expected output side by side
   instead of one after another

If tests names are given, only they will be executed, otherwise all found
tests will. Tests are found by .htmltest extension in 'tests' directory.

== Writing tests ==

Test files contain wiki text and expected HTML output separated by '@@@@' line:

{{{
*bold*
@@@@
<p>
<strong>bold</strong>
</p>
}}}

= Implementation =

Test tool finds all (or explicitly requested) tests, splits them into wiki text
and expected HTML output and write them to 'wiki' and 'expected' directories
respectively.

Then vim is started with instructions to generate HTML in 'actual' directory
and quit.

Files from 'expected' and 'actual' directories are them compared.
